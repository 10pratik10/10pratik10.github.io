<b>I have few issue which I didn't fixed yet due to ongoing exams. I would be happy, if you assist in fixing some issues listed below</b>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive layout for different smartphone size</li>
<li>iPhone notch layout for latest iPhone model, ie, iPhone 14 and previous iPhone respectively</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<b>I have fixed the responsive layout issues by categorising each size of device, so that it will be easy to strech the  size of contents, iPhone notch problem haven't solved yet but working on it!</b>
<p></p>
<b>Right now, we have two issues which are yet to solve, iPhone notch and glowing icon. Working on gradiant feature.</b>
