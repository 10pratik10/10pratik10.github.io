<h1>My Portfolio Website</h2>
I created a portfolio website. I started creating the website about 1 month before it was hosted on Github server. I would like make it as open source project to contribute the developers, students and learner among us. I am thankful to for those who contributed in my project in fixing some critical error and hosting issues.
<h2>Here is my link to site</h2>

<b>I have few issue which I didn't fixed yet due to ongoing exams. I would be happy, if you assist in fixing some issues listed below</b>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive layout for different smartphone size</li>
<li>iPhone notch layout for latest iPhone model, ie, iPhone 14 and previous iPhone respectively</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<b>I have fixed the responsive layout issues by categorising each size of device, so that it will be easy to strech the  size of contents, iPhone notch problem haven't solved yet but working on it!</b>
<p></p>
<b>Right now, we have two issues which are yet to solve, iPhone notch and glowing icon. Working on gradiant feature.</b>
<b>A kind feedback will be welcome, kindly do feedback me on pratikcyber10@gmail.com for suggesting some changes or bug related issue</b>
